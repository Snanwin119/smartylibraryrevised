            "What's Up, Doc?" Find out in this lively biography of the most
            celebrated director in animation history! Charles Martin "Chuck"
            Jones was an American animator, cartoon artist, screenwriter,
            producer, and director of many classic animated cartoon shorts. They
            starred Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, the Road Runner and Wile E. Coyote,
            Pep√© Le Pew, Porky Pig and a slew of other Warner Brothers
            characters. When he moved on to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, his work
            includes a series of Tom and Jerry shorts as well as the television
            adaptation of Dr. Seuss's How the Grinch Stole Christmas. Jones was
            nominated for eight Academy Awards, won three, and received an
            honorary Oscar for his work in the animation industry. His career
            spanned almost seventy years, during which he made over 250 animated
            films, including What's Opera, Doc?, a classic Bugs Bunny/Elmer Fudd
            short that is considered to be one of the greatest cartoons of all
            time.
